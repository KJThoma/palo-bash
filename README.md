# palo-bash
This script will backup a Palo Alto Firewall config.xml to hostnameDATE.xml

For automated backups this can be set as a cron job.

Note that you must create and save the Palo XML API Key first, protect this like a password: https//<firewall-ip>/api/?type=keygen&user=<username>&password=<password>
